* Using Lambdas
* Functional Interfaces
* Method references
* Collections improvements

##### Advantages of Lambdas:
* Enables functional programming
	* we can pass a function name to a method to get it called on a certain condition.
* Readable and concise code
* Easier-to-use APIs and libraries
* Enables support for parallel processing

##### Functional vs OOP
* Both can achieve the same
* Functional programmign gives a more readable and hence more maintainable code.
* Functional programming is elegant in certain situatio, but not always. We may need to use Object oriented programming in some other cases.
* In OOP all code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects.
